	   <p>
	   <div id="text">The purpose of UC ACM-W is to increase <b><font color="#0000A0"> recruitment and retention of women </font></b> in computing at the University of Cincinnati. The number of women in computer science and other fields of computing is 
       falling and we will strive to educate women throughout the pipeline, girls in K-12, undergraduate and graduate students on the benefits of a computing. The organization will aim to align with the university’s 
       diversity campaign and will serve as an outreach organization for current women and also, men in the field of computing.
